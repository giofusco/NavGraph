nodeinfo.type:      type of node, for now it can be Destination, Control and Link
nodeinfo.position:  position of the node in the map ([u,v])
nodeinfo.floor:     what floor the node is on (string)
nodeinfo.label:     a short description of the node (i.e. Room 443) (string)
nodeinfo.isDoor:    is the node/destination reachable after passing through a door (boolean)
nodinfo.comments:   extended information about the nodes (e.g. include heads up about possible 
                    obstacles or dangerous situations) (string)
nodeinfo.edges:     a list of outgoing edges 

an edge consists of:
dest: id of the destination node

       (0 degrees is pointing straight to the right, 90 upward, -90 downward, -180 straight to the left)
